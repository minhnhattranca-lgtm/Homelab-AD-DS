## Jan 17, 2026 (happy new year - horseyyyyyyyyyyy)
- Designed a basic network diagram for the Active Directory project.

- Installed VMware Workstation Pro.

- Learned the basic VMware interface (creating, starting, and managing virtual machines).

- Created multiple virtual machines.
- Also cloned some vms for later uses.
- Installed and configured the following operating systems:
  - Windows 10
  - Windows Server
  - Ubuntu Server
  - Kali Linux
- This was my first time working with Linux, so I was curious to practice more on this.
- Verified that all virtual machines booted correctly and were ready for further configuration.
- The goal for the next time will be to create AD and add guest/account/..... blah blah blah
